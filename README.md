# Simple-Python-Projects

Some projects I've made in the last year while I've been learning Python. I have more, but most are unsuccessful and others will be in a different repository.


-Pong: A simple ping-pong game, nothing too fancy. There's some problems with the collisions between ball and pong, it's not completely accurate and the ball will 
          phase through the right paddle if you don't hit it just right(on the top of the paddle). The game freezes once you are finished, and I was planning on adding
          Settings so you can change some things like the speed the ball is moving. I never got around to it...
    
    
-Random-Number-Guesser: A simple guessing game. 



-Rock-Paper-Scissors: I really enjoyed this one, for as simple a game it is to program.
